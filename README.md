# py-ai-target-hit-detection
Python based AI for detecting hits to a target in competitive target shooting.

Program dependencies:
none for now

work in progress and im using this to learn how to use computer vision AI

base version will include the ability to detect hits on a metal or paper target from any camera angle

two modes:
autonomous mode: program does its best to tell what a hit is vs any other frame difference
operator mode: when hit is detected, program prompts operator with the first changed frame to verify the hit <---- this will be done first

later:
the ability to count score with the script
automated shot detection (through microphone input) and shot timing

im working on it lol <3

progress:
camera feed intake: 1/10
visual processing: --/10
hit tracking and vizualization: --/10

i love ffmpeg (they played an integral part in this project and im giving them credit with this statement dont sue me ily)
